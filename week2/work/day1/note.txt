Population: Real thing in the world, but I might not have access to it.
(Deterministic until I Sample from it);

This has a true population mean(average), variance, etc.

statistic: any function of a random sample;

estimator: a statistic that tells us something about a property of the population;

sampling distribution: $avg_x=formula:[];

How could I estimate the true average height u? :
1.use sample mean.
2.use biggest + smallest / 2;
3.use median: value that split data in half.

Imagine we repeat our measuring experiment a whole bunch of times.
Take a sample of n = 100, compute sample mean x, do that 1000 times.

sampling distribution: plot the distribution of the sample means, called the sampling distribution.
turns out that the average of the sampling distribution will get very close to the true mean.

avg = fraction(1,n) > multiply sum(i=0,)

standard error is how much the sampling distribution varies around its average.
    a function of sample size;
standard deviation: how much things actual vary.
standard error is the standard devition of the sampling distribution.

confidence internval: if you repeat the process 100 times, roughly p% of the  intervals I constructed will contain the true population mean.

1^2 + 2^2 - 2(2)(1) = 1
2^2 + 2^2 - 2(2)(2) = 4 + 4 - 8 = 0
3^2 + 2^2 - 2(2)(3) = 9 + 4 - 12 = 1

1 + 4 + 9 = 14
