1. Picking Control Variables: Imagine you have one data point from every county in the US that gives the unemployment rate in that county 
in 2010 and the amount of money spent by that country on job training programs in 2008. You want to know the treatment eï¬€ect of money 
spent on job training programs onto the outcome of unemployment (as measured two years later). 
List as many examples as you can think of for each category of control variable:
(a) Confounding variables: wealth of the county, money spent on previous years.
(b) Variance-reducing variables: # of new business/jobs, economic growth/decline
(c) Unrelated variables: number of new born, most popular song for county.
(d) Bad Controls: unemployment rate in 2011.
