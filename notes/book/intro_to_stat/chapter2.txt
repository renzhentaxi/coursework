The aim in statistics is to learn the characteristics of a population on the basis of a sample 
selected from the population;
    This requires us to consider the variation in the data.

variation:
    present in any set of data.

Random sampling: select randomly a given number of objects from the population.

Cluster sampling: select randomly a given number of clusters of objects from the population.

common problems that occurs in data that one should be aware of 
    Problems with samples:
        when the sample is not a representative of the population.
        When the sample is biased.
    Data quality: 
        avoidable errors introduced to the data via inaccurate handling of forms, mistakes in the input of data.
    
    Self-selected samples: respones only by people who choose to respond, such as call-in surveys, 
        that are often biased.

    Sample Size Issues: samples that are too small may be unreliable. Larger samples, when possible, are better.
        small samples are unavoidable in some situations but can they can still be used to draw conclusion

    Undue Influence: Collecting data or asking questions in a way that influences the response.

    Causality: a relationship between two variables does not mean that one causes the other.It could be that they
        are just correlated with each other.
    
    Self-funded/self-interest: when the studyis performed by a person in order to support their claim.

    misleading use of data: improperly displayed graphs and incomplete data.

    confounding: when the effects of multiple factors on a response cannot be separated they are confounding or
        confusing. they make it difficult to draw valid conclusions about the effect of each factor.
