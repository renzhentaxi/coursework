testing

expectation: marks the center of the distribution of a random variable. It is equivalent to the data average x and the population average u.
    it is used in order to mark the location of the distribution of the data and the population respectively.

E(X) = sum [x * P(x)]
Var(X) = sum [ (x-E(X))^2 * P(x)]

general laws that govern this variability in repetitions

The average of sevearl indepdendent repeats of the measurement is less variable and more reproducible than each of the single measurements themselves.
