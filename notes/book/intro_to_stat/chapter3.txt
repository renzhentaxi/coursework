Inter-quartile-range:
    the distance between the third quartile and the first quartile.
Outlier:
    a data point that is larger than the third quartile plus the inter-quartile-range*1.5; Q3 + 1.5 * IRQ
    a data point that is smaller than the Q1 - 1.5 * IRQ;

boxplot:
    the whiskers extend to the smallest and largest value that is not an outlier.

median is often better measure of the center when there are extreme values or outliers because it is not affected
by the precise numerical values of theoutlier.

in a perfectly symmetrical distribution: mean and median are the same.
if the distribution of data is skewed to the right then the median is less than the mean.

if the distribution of data is skewed to the left then themedian is more than the mean.

measure of the spread of data
    inter-quartile range
    standard deviation

variance:
    sum(deviation_squared)/n-1
    when only the freqency is supplied instead of the actual data.
        sum(deviation_squared*frequency)/n-1
