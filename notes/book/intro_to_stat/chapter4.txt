Consider the distribution of a variable in a population and compute parameters of this distribution, such as the mean and the standard deviation.

Become familiar with the concept of a random variable

Understand the relation between the distribution of the population and the distribution of a random varaible produced by sampling a random subject 
from the population.

Identify the distribution of the random variable in simple settings and compute its expectation and variance.


population variability: how the individuals vary within a population
    mean/median/q1/q3/varaince/standard deviation of a population.
random variable: uncertainty/randomness. 
    a random varaible is the future outcome of a measurement, before the measurement is taken.
    It does not have a specific value, but rather a collection of potential values with a distribution over these values.
    After the measurement is taken and the specific value is revealed then the random variable ceases to be a random variable! Instead, it becomes data.

A radnom variable is typically the outcome of an observation, a measurement, or a function thereof.
A randomv ariable is characterized via the collection of potential values it may obtain, known as the sample space and the likelihood of obtaining each of the
values in the sample space.

a Random variable is chracterized via the collection of potential valeus it may obtain, known as the sample space and the likelihood of obtaining each of the values
in the sample space.
population variance is divided by n
where as sample variance is divided by n-1

Sample space: all the possible value a random variable can be.
the probability function of a random variable is defined for any value that the random variable may obtain and produces the distribution of the random varaible.
    this probability can come from relative frequency or as a result of theoretical modeling.
